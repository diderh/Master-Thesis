# Project Overview
This R script analyzes the effects of environmental stressors (such as light pollution and crayfish presence) on macroinvertebrate functional diversity in aquatic ecosystems. The workflow processes benthic macroinvertebrate data, assigns trait information, calculates multiple functional diversity indices, and performs advanced statistical analyses to assess impacts of treatments across time and positions.
